# MNIST example runs after intro train

Once we've trained the MNIST intro example, we can see an associated
run:

    >>> run("guild runs -o examples")
    [1:...]  ./examples/mnist/mnist-intro:train  ...  completed
    [2:...]  ./examples/simple-mnist/train.py    ...  completed
    [3:...]  ./examples/simple-mnist/train       ...  completed  epochs=1
    <exit 0>
