# Resources after `mnist` install

Once we've installed the `mnist` package, we have the following
resources available:

    >>> run("guild resources")
    <exit 0>

UPDATE Jul 2018: It's not clear that package resources are useful
given Guild's recently added cross-package inheritance support. If
package resources aren't useful, we'll remove support for them and
remove this test.
