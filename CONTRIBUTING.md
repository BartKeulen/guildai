# Contributing to Guild AI

Please read this document before you send a patch:

- Guild AI uses the [Collective Code Construction
  Contract](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/42/) process for
  contributions. Please read this if you are unfamiliar with it.

Guild AI grows by the slow and careful accretion of simple, minimal
solutions to real problems faced by many people.

- Each patch defines one clear and agreed problem, and one clear,
  minimal, plausible solution. Avoid large, complex problems and
  large, complex solutions.

- We will usually merge patches aggressively, without a blocking
  review.

- Merged patches typically undergo revisions by maintainers or other
  contributes. If a merged patch cannot be appropriately revised we
  will remove it with reverting patch along with an explanation.

This contribution policy is adapted from the [Zero MQ
project](https://github.com/zeromq/czmq/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and authored primarily by our late friend [Pieter
Hintjens](https://github.com/hintjens).
