# MNIST example runs after intro train

Once we've trained the MNIST intro example, we can see an associated
run:

    >>> run("guild runs -o ./examples")
    [0:31ef3754]  ./examples/mnist/mnist-intro:train  2018-09-13 11:15:13  completed
    <exit 0>

Here we see the run for the MNIST example `mnist-intro`.
