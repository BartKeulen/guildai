# Guild Example: `languages`

This example shows how Guild works with various runtime languages.

- [guild.yml](guild.yml) - Project Guild file
- [noisy.r](noisy.r) - R example

## R Examples

To run the R example, run:

    $ guild run R-noisy

Press `Enter` to run the sample training operation using the default
values.

`R-noisy` is equivalent to the model used in [Guild Get
Started](https://guild.ai/docs/start/). Refer to the steps in that guide to
apply Guild features to this example.
