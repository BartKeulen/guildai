  description: >
    Alternative implementation of downstream-separation-with-dirs

    This approach avoids linking or copying upstream directories,
    which both have drawbacks. Linking exposes the upstream run to
    corruption and copying can be expensive.

  main: downstream2 inputs/checkpoint.txt outputs/checkpoint.txt
  requires:
    - operation: upstream
      select: models/checkpoint.txt
      target-path: inputs
      target-type: link # could be copy as well
